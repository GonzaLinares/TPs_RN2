A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA\\n\\n\\nI.\\n\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him\\nmention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\\nakin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\\nthe world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\\nfalse position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\\nand a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for\\ndrawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\\nthrow a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\n\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\\nfrom each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\\nsoul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\\nnature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\\nobservation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\\nmysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\n\\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\\nmy way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\\nextraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\\nstory. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\\n\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\\nto see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\\n\\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put\\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\\n\\n“Seven!” I answered.\\n\\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\\nthat you intended to go into harness.”\\n\\n“Then, how do you know?”\\n\\n“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\\nservant girl?”\\n\\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have\\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\\ncountry walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\\nhave changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.”\\n\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\n\\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\\nscored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\\norder to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\\n\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\nprocess of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\\n“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\\nreasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.”\\n\\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\ndown into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The\\ndistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.”\\n\\n“Frequently.”\\n\\n“How often?”\\n\\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\\n\\n“Then how many are there?”\\n\\n“How many? I don’t know.”\\n\\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\\nmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\\nboth seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw\\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\\nupon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\\n\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n\\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it\\nsaid, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\\ndeepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\\nEurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\\nwear a mask.”\\n\\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\\nmeans?”\\n\\n“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\\nit?”\\n\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\nwritten.\\n\\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\\nstiff.”\\n\\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English\\npaper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\\n\\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G”\\nwith a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\\n\\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\\n\\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\\n\\n“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’\\nwhich is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like\\nour ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\\nfrom his shelves.
